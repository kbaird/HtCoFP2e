This is just a repo for running through the code exercises for Simon Thompson's

Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming, 2nd Edition

The book's URL is
  http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/craft2e/

I also suggest downloading the code for this edition of the book from
  http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/craft2e/Code/code.html

There is now a 3rd edition of the book available, as well.
